          <p class="sample-text">
            The IDEAS (Integrated Design, Engineering & Applied Science) minor
            at Wesleyan is a minor about... integrated design, engineering, and
            applied science. I officially declared the minor fall semester
            senior year, and my coursework has been comprised of: 
            <ul>
                <li>Computer Science I & II</li>
                <li>Algorithms and Complexity</li>
                <li>Videogame Development</li>
                <li>Form and Code</li>
                <li>Introduction to Mechanical Engineering</li>
                <li>Introduction to Electrical Engineering</li>
            </ul>
            Through the minor I have partaken in several large projects that have honed my organizational, 
            teamwork, and design skills while also helping show me how to blend different disciplines, like design and tech. As a CS major,
            I've loved being able to work on big coding projects that come from a more design-oriented place, as well as having opportunities to 
            delve into the physical realm with mechanical and electrical engineering projects.

          <p class="sample-text">
           Morse Bot is my final team project from IDEA175 — Intro to Electrical Engineering that I made along with Miranda Derossi.
           Morse Bot is a little robot coded in Arduino that lets you tweet by inputting morse code via an arcade button and a send button, 
           while also displaying the morse code on an integrated LCD screen, and providing additional sound and light feedback with an LED and buzzer.
           The robot sends an HTTP request with the morse code to a backend server I wrote and deployed that converts it to
           English and communciates with the Twitter developer API to post the tweet!

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Design Process</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            We started with the idea of doing... something in morse code, and after some talking we decided that we wanted 
            to be able to connect to the internet, and soon after we decided that it would be fun to have people 
            Tweet via morse code... a feature nobody has ever asked for but we decided to create anyway!
            Once we had decided on that, we had to actually figure out how to do it. 
            We used an ESP32 board because it had a built in wifi module that we could use to send HTTP requests.

        <div class="text-left pt-5">
          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Wireless Challenges</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            Originally, we wanted to be able to connect 2 ESPs together, and have them communicate—you press a button on one and 
            it outputs a light on another. We first tried to use an HC-05 external bluetooth module, and we were able to find 
            plenty of documentation online about connecting a phone to an HC-05, but nothing about connecting two together. Our group
            made the decision here to simply give up on this approach, as it appeared it was a dead end not worth sinking more time into.
            Instead, we pivoted to using the ESP wireless capabilities, and a feature called ESPNOW. This was able to connect the 2 ESPs together,
            but we weren't able to get them to connect to the internet as well. I decided that getting 2 ESPs together was outside the 
            essential scope of our project, and that it was better to focus on the core capability of getting the bot to tweet, so we decided to 
            abandon the 2 ESP concept, which turned out to be the right idea. By abandoning the out-of-scope idea of connecting a second 
            bot we were able to easily connect our main ESP to the internet!

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Connecting to The Internet</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            Once we had wireless capabilities, we actually had to figure out the specifics of interacting with The Internet. We ran 
            into some issues with the ESP board and the process for using the Twitter API because there weren't ESP libraries that supported the 
            proper OAuth flows needed for Twitter. So, to get around this issue, I built a Python Flask server that I hosted on Google Firebase.
            Instead of sending requests right to Twitter, our ESP sent requests to my Python server, which converted from Morse to English, authenticated 
            our Twitter account, and sent an HTTP request to Twitter! This was fun and easy for me because I have had a lot of experience building Python
            web apps, and a LOT of experience with Firebase, so it was cool to put that knowledge to use!

          <p class="sample-text">
            Once we were able to interact with the Twitter API, we were able to successfully tweet! We made multiple tweets to 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/MorseBot1">@MorseBot1</a> on Twitter! The sensitivity and the timing on how to determine 
            when a new word is formed is a little wonky, hence the weird spacing, but overall the bot works! It also outputs beeps and 
            lights as the user presses buttons! Below you can see some final tweets, as well as some that messed up along the way.
