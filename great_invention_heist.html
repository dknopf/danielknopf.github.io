            The Great Invention Heist is a 2D drag-and-drop game meant to teach
            STEM to 2nd-4th graders. I worked with four other teammates to build
            this game over a semester at Wesleyan while taking a video game
            development class with Bethesda founder Chris Weaver. I coded a lot
            of the UI and the game mechanics in Unity/C#, wrote the dialogue,
            and handled level design and organization. The game was a smash
            success—it was rated the most fun by students and received lots of
            acclaim from a panel of industry judges. You can play the game
            online

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Designing and Planning!</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            During the spring semester of my Sophomore year at Wes I took a
            video game development class that split us into teams of 5 and
            tasked us with creating a video game that would teach STEM to grade
            schoolers. Our team decided on the vague idea of a time travel drag
            and drop game where kids would combine items to create famous
            inventions. During this design phase I made sure to iron out many of
            the important details of our game, such as a general story, basic
            level structure, and game rules, because I knew that laying down
            these foundations early on would prevent misunderstandings and
            wasted work. I also made sure we were within appropriate scope,
            specifically by lobbying for the removal of a planned game mode that
            I could tell would take more time than we had while not providing
            adequate fun/learning.

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Coding!</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            This was the first major team project I worked on, so in order to
            ensure team cohesion I scheduled semi-frequent engineering meetings
            with the other two engineers to map out all of the scripts,
            controllers, and variables we would need and how they would interact
            with each others' code. We created a modular level system that
            allowed us to add in new levels with ease, given the right assets,
            and I personally created a system of reusable modals that were quite
            handy in our modal-filled game.

          <p class="sample-text">
            We chose to explain many of our STEM concepts through text and
            diagrams, so I put my English major to good use writing item
            descriptions, scientific explanations, hints, and witty puns in a
            style that kids would be able to understand and <em>enjoy</em>.
            Furthermore, I would work closely with our artist on the diagrams
            that accompanied much of this text so that kids who were more visual
            would have a good grasp of what was going on as well.

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Level Design</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            The crux of our game revolved around combining objects on screen to
            make bigger, more complex objects. For example, combining an engine
            and fuel creates a fueled engine, which can then be placed into a
            plane to make a motorized plane. In order to give kids as much
            freedom as possible, so that they could explore and feel a sense of
            achievement and curisoity, we had to allow these combinations to
            occur in different orders—you could put the wheels of the plane on
            before the engine, or after the engine, before the rudden and engine
            or after the rudder and engine, before the engine but after the
            rudder, you get it. Keeping track of all of those possibilities
            required a huge amount of organization, so for every level the other
            level designer and I would create a huge spreadsheet outlining every
            possible interaction between every possible item (red = failed
            combination, white = successful combination into new item, yellow =
            failed combination with explanation on why it failed, to guide the
            player). Furthermore, as the player progressed the levels got more
            difficult, which can be seen in the complexity of our spreadsheets.

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Testing</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            Once we had a working prototype of our first three levels done, we
            decided that we needed to actually test our game on some real
            participants, so we wrangled up a gaggle of cousins, siblings, and
            kids of teachers to create a beta testing group. We then video
            called each child and watched as they played the levels, and then
            asked them some questions. We wanted to see whether kids in the
            right age group could understand our puzzles and actually learn
            something from our game. By asking the testers about topics before
            and after they played the level, and then again after they finished
            the overall game, we were able to gauge how much information they
            retained and understood. From our testing we determined that kids
            were able to understand the concepts we presented, and we also
            gained various valuable insights about the gameplay, which prompted
            us to add a tutorial level, increase the number of failed collisions
            that provided helpful messages, and make other aspects of the game
            more representative of our user base.

          <h3 class="text-heading title_color">Final Product!</h3>
          <p class="sample-text">
            Due to our successful scoping, organization, and planning, we were
            able to complete five full game levels, as well as a tutorial level.
            We chose to forgo creating a sixth level, 2_3, so that we could
            focus on polishing up our game and adding juice. We added in
            particle effects galore, additional modals, easter eggs, and tested
            the heck out of our final product to ensure it lived up to our
            standards. At the end of our class, all the teams sent their games
            to a class of elementary schoolers, who rated each game based on how
            fun it was and how difficult it was. Our game was rated the most fun
            of all games in the class, and our difficult was centered right
            around the middle, which reflected our desire for it to be
            challenging enough to be entertaining but not too challenging to be
            discouraging. Additionally, when we presented our game to a group of
            industry professionals as part of a competition at the end of the
            course, they all loved our game and gave us first place, admiring
            the methods we were using to teach STEM and our dedication to making
            our game kid-friendly! This game remains one of my proudest
            accomplishments and most valued projects.
